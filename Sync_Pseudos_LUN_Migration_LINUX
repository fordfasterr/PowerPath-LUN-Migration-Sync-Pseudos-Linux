Linux L2 - Arniella, Jan. 2016.

sync pseudo's between 2 hosts with PowerPath: 

Section A: Determine pseudo order between 2 nodes, run this on each node: 

1. Generate list of all pseudo's and lun IDs: 

	#powermt display dev=all|grep -i "pseudo\|clariion\|logical" > new_maps1
	
	It will look something like this: 

		Pseudo name=emcpoweraq
		CLARiiON ID=FNM00093800247 [useclqcll688db]
		Logical device ID=60060160C6092600FC279EFC0A3DE311 [LUN 165 - useclqcll688dba-b - New /NBCOQ079_FB03]
		....


2. combine (the 3 lines at a time) into 1 line from the previous file: 

	#cat new_maps1 | paste - - - > new_maps2

	It will look something like this: 

		Pseudo name=emcpoweraq  CLARiiON ID=FNM00093800247 [useclqcll688db]     Logical device ID=60060160C6092600FC279EFC0A3DE311 [LUN 165 - useclqcll688dba-b - New /NBCOQ079_FB03]


3. Prepare a list of LUN ID's, no colons, and all uppercase into a file named: list
	This is usually provided earlier by storage team during provisioning phase..
	It will look something like this: 

		#cat list
		600601606EE031003F292A151F8AE511
		600601606EE03100ADD9DCD51E8AE511
		600601606EE0310039F715391F8AE511
		....

4. Extract the pseudo names in order: 

	for i in `cat list`; do grep $i new_maps2|awk '{print $2}'; done
	Now if you compare your LUN ID list with the new pseudo list between node A & B, 
	you will see if they are in order or not.

	You will end up with a list like this:

		name=emcpowerbo
		name=emcpowerbb
		name=emcpowerbk
		name=emcpowerbp
		name=emcpowercg
		....


5. Final step, compare the outputs between node A & B, if they match you are done, if not, proceed to section B.


Section B: Sync the pseudos using emcpadm utility.

1. Export the mappings from node A, and copy it to Node B, run this on node A.
	
	emcpadm export_mappings -x -f mappingsa.txt   (-x is for xml format, easy to manually modify).

2. Verify the mappings in node B.. Be sure you are not changing any of the OLD luns... 

	emcpadm check_mappings -v -x -f mappingsa.txt

	Output looks like this.. 

		emcpowerx         no change    (These are old luns, not changed..)
		emcpowerw         no change
		emcpowery         no change
		emcpowerbb        remaps: emcpowerbp  emcpowerbb   (these are new luns, will be changed...)
		emcpowerbc        remaps: emcpowerbb  emcpowerbc
		emcpowerbd        remaps: emcpowerbf  emcpowerbd


3. Once verified, proceed to import the mappings ... 

	emcpadm import_mappings -v -x -f mappingsa.txt

	Output looks like this: 
	
		... Mapped emcpowerbb
		... Mapped emcpowerbc
		... Mapped emcpowerbd



You may now repeat Section A to verify that the luns match between both nodes A & B.

	Once you have a sync, your LUN ID's will match the Pseudo names on both nodes, as per below example (excel): 
		LUN:					NodeA:		NodeB:
		600601606EE031003F292A151F8AE511	emcpowerbo	emcpowerbo
		600601606EE03100ADD9DCD51E8AE511	emcpowerbb	emcpowerbb
		600601606EE0310039F715391F8AE511	emcpowerbk	emcpowerbk


** Notes & thoughts: 

1. Q: If you can get a list of possible remaps from Section B: step 2, why bother doing Section A? 
   A: You've got to be 100% sure that you are not re-mapping any of the old LUNS.  Doing so will break Oracle, 
	and possibly other filesystems... You can only get rid of the old LUNs once you have fully migrated
	all of the data from them into the new luns.. So in this early stage you must not touch the old LUNs.
